But are these claims of population explosion mere outdated scaremongering or do they bear some truth? Taking cues from the groundbreaking research of statistics guru, Hans Rosling, Misconception offers a fascinating glimpse at how the world is tackling these population shifts.

As all three subjects point to the continued failure of top-down policy making to serve the best interests of their populations, Misconception forges an insight into this highly charged political issue, on a human level, to reveal how we are all ultimately striving for the same goal.",
